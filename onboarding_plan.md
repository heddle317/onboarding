Week 1:
======
Touch base with them daily, at least.  If you don’t hear from them, check in-- better to do that early and get them unstuck then leave them.
### Day 1 and 2 ### 
* Buddy up with last person to get dev env up and running. Introduce mentor, make it clear it’s totally OK to ask all kinds of questions.
* New engineer updates dev environment documentation if it’s out of date or confusing.(They feel like they’re contributing, and your documentation is better as a result!)
* Any technical tools or frameworks they need to know but don’t, yet, hand them the right books/material to get them started.  (Technical Material)

### Day 3-5 ### 
* Get them started on blogging/journaling-for themselves and for you: 3 things per day or week that they didn’t understand, three new things they’ve learned, etc.  You can take a look at it together, or have them email it to you, so you’re aware of what they’re thinking about.
* It’s helpful for a new developer to keep a “Things I’ve learned” file somewhere, for reference later- this can keep information such as what directory one should be in when running certain sporadically-used commands, and to remind them later of details they may forget.
* Ideally have them ship something small to learn the process for shipping and releasing code (can just be config files or a really small one line change).
* Introduce a small, well scoped project that is not time-sensitive for product, that shouldn’t be too technically complex, but gives them an opportunity to start learning the code style of your company. 
* Onboarding social event.


Week 2 
======
* Get them started on updating anything in the docs that isn’t accurate anymore, or that was confusing to them. Introduce the idea that they’re not going to be useful for a while, that they’re just going to learn as much as they can.
* Have someone explain history of company, company coding philosophies, and company leadership and team philosophies.
* Give the new eng a map of people on team, what they work on, area of expertise, everyone has to update when new employees start): Tell them “This is Adam, he’s the resident expert on ____.  This is Allison, she’s great with _____.  You can go to her for questions about ____ and ____ as well….” etc.  Should also include managers, team leads, and other leadership roles on engineering.
* Start them shadowing/pairing with people for maybe an hr a day, or for a longer chunk once a week.  Their partner talks out loud about what they’re doing, their process, etc; this is great for learning how different people think through things, and also gives a sense of the flow of process re: testing, committing, reviewing, etc.
* Introduce code labs as well; twice a week, perhaps an hour each time.  This is a chance for the engineer to bring questions to you; for example, “What is RabbitMQ” or “How do I get more information about a sentry error”. It might also be “I have this unexpected behavior happening and I don’t know why, can we look at it?” There may be some topics you think are important to spend time on, but do also leave time for unrelated questions.  Note: In code lab, it’s important to assess where the Jr Eng’s knowledge ends/begins, so it’s really handy to ask what may be simple questions to establish what they do/don’t know.  Asking them to explain something to YOU is uncomfortable for them, but reveals where knowledge gaps are; just make sure you do this in an environment where it’s TOTALLY OK to not know the answers.

Week 3:
======
* Start setting some goals, for what you think they can achieve, and what they WANT to achieve, in a month, in 3 months, 6 months, a year.  It helps to ask them what their goals are, first. Maybe in a week you hope they’ll have a handle on your source control system.  Perhaps after a month you expect them to be able to figure out where to look in your code for a bug based on the info in a sentry error. Maybe in 6 months you hope they’ll be able to provide useful comments and suggestions on code reviews.  Maybe they’ll have goals of their own, weaknesses of their own, that they want to address in these goals.
* Have junior engineers give a 5 or 10 minute presentation on a small topic either biweekly or monthly (i.e. generators, decorators, Django ORM layer); this should be something you think they should go off and research independently, that will be useful to them in the long run.
* When they’ve finished a project, give them feedback not only on what they could improve for next time, but also what they’ve done well. We tend to assume that, if we don’t say anything, the other person knows what they’re doing is OK… but it’s hard to assess how you’re doing at the beginning, and feedback is usually really appreciated. This is a great thing to include in one-on-one.
* Introduce weekly one-on-ones, if you haven’t already. (Sample outline below) 
    * 10-20min: engineer goes into detail explaining something they learned in the last week (preferably technical). 
    * 5-10min: manager goes into detailing explaining something the engineer did well during the last week and why. 
    * Chunk of time dedicated to checking in with the junior engineer (any roadblocks, etc). 
    * Chunk of time dedicated to one thing the engineer can focus improving during the next week (i.e. code coverage, smaller functions, comments, smaller commit chunks, whatever).

Week 4:
======
* Have them go back to things they learned in the last month, and explain a concept from start to finish.  Maybe it was something you went over in code lab 3 weeks ago; see what has stuck in their brain, and where you can fill in gaps that have been overlooked.  It shouldn’t feel like a test, but rather a chance to say, in their own words, what they’ve learned.  It can be 5 minutes of time during code lab or a one-on-one, but it’s useful to revisit the things you learned in context of all the stuff you’ve done in the intervening time.
* Continue to check in regularly; perhaps still daily, just to say “How’s it going?  How are you feeling about everything?  Anything you need a hand with?” It may seem obvious to you that they can ask for help, but you’d be surprised what a difference actually voicing this can make.
* At some point, you can discontinue the shadowing or at least bring it down to once a week, or have it be an elective on the jr engineer’s part.  Can taper off the “3 things I’ve learned/ 3 things I didn’t get”; you can check in with your eng and see how helpful these are to them. 
* Once they’ve done a small project on their own, maybe they’d like to pair with a more sr member of the team on a project, where they take turns driving. 

Beyond:
======
* Touch base regularly on their goals, whether there are any roadblocks to achieving them, etc.
* This is all an organic process, intended to get them up and running and confident as quickly as possible; if something’s not working for either of you, feel free to discontinue, or modify it to fit your needs. Especially after the first month, a lot of on-boarding ends up being specific to your company, your needs for this person, their interests; the tools we’ve listed are a good starting point, but you’ll need to tailor your onboarding in months 2+ for yourself, your new engineer, and your company.
* Apprenticeship- Sr eng gets code minion
